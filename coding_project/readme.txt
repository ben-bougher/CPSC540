NW regression is very similar to KNN, but a continuous kernel is used to make a weighted
average of the training data and make a prediction.

I have made it very easy to collaborate on this project, simply write additional kernel
functions.

I wrote a Gaussian and a La Place kernel, but any shading window or distribution can be
made into a kernel.

Suggestions:

matLearn_kernel_StudentT
matLearn_kernel_Hanning
matLearn_kernel_Blackman

See matLearn_kernel_Gaussian and regression_NW_demo for an example. 

Write a kernel, get the collaboration credit.
