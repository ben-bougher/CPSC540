This repository is setup to jointly develop the best implementations to 
course problem sets. At the end of every assignment an initial solution code
will be checked in. Students will hopefully review it and revise it in order to 
make it more efficient, readable, and better. Hopefully at the end of the course this
repository will be a great resource of excellent implementations of machine learning
algorithms.

It is also a great opportunity to learn about git and gain some confidence in making
your code public.
